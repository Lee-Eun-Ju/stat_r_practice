For this your turn use the fbiwide data.

1. Use gather or pivot_longer from the tidyr package to combine the variables for the different types of crimes into one variable. Call the key-value pair “Type” and “Incidences”. Compute a crime rate
```{r}
fbi = read.csv("fbi.csv")

```


2. Only consider crime rates for Iowa and Minnesota. Use spread or pivot_wider to create incidence columns for each of these states. Plot crimes in Iowa against crimes in Minnesota, colour by type of crime. Note: you need to exclude some variables.
```{r}

```
